Some ideas for questions to ask on langdev.stackexchange.com:

- How is the meaning of a program like a board game (*"What is game semantics?"*)?
- How can I track consumable resources at a type-level (*"What are linear types?"*)?
- How can I describe communication protocols at a type-level (*"What are session types?"*)?
- What is "full abstraction" and why is it tricky for the PCF language (*this could motivate the game semantics questions*)?
- How can I implement an interpreter where undefined variables are treated as "uninterpreted symbols"? (*"What is normalization-by-evaluation, aka NbE?"*)?
- How can I determine properties of implementations of a function when I'm just given its type? (*"What is relational parametricity?"*)
- What are logical relations? They seem to be both a proof technique as well as a mathematical object studied in their own right.

The linear types, session types and game semantics questions might all relate to each other.

If the phrasing of any of these is useful to anyone, I would appreciate a brief note saying that my list was helpful!
