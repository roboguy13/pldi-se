Some ideas for questions to ask on langdev.stackexchange.com:

- How is the meaning of a program like a board game ("What is game semantics?")?
- How can I determine implementations of a function when I'm just given its type? ("What is relational parametricity?")
- What is "full abstraction" and why is it tricky for the PCF language (this could motivate the game semantics questions)?
- How can I implement an interpreter where undefined variables are treated as "uninterpreted symbols"? ("What is normalization-by-evaluation?")?
- What are logical relations? They seem to be both a proof technique as well as a mathematical object studied in their own right.

If the phrasing of any of these is useful to anyone, I would appreciate a brief note saying that my list was helpful!
